1
00:00:01,837 --> 00:00:04,340
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not kidding myself.

2
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:08,177
Anchorage isn't New York City,
but it's not Cambodia, right?

3
00:00:08,344 --> 00:00:12,014
Do you know how many Chinese
restaurants are in Anchorage? Five.

4
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:15,684
There's 14 movie theatres,
two practically kosher delis,

5
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:17,895
and if we're talking about freezing,

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,273
the temperature's only
five degrees lower than Indiana,

7
00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:23,943
despite the differential in precipitation.

8
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:28,656
Ginger ale, and another
Scotch for the businessman.

9
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,701
So, anyway, it's not as if Alaska
was part of my game plan,

10
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:35,829
but I've always thought
that medicine was for me,

11
00:00:35,955 --> 00:00:40,417
ever since I played doctor with
Katie Kaplan in the second grade.

12
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:44,713
I had the desire, the grades...
I just didn't have the bucks.

13
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:48,092
Do you know what it costs
to go to medical school?

14
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:50,261
A lot.

15
00:00:50,344 --> 00:00:54,223
I know what you're thinking.
Scholarship, right?

16
00:00:54,265 --> 00:00:58,686
Let's face it. Jewish doctors are
not exactly an endangered species.

17
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:00,855
Three dollars, please.

18
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:05,943
So, 75 scholarship applications later,

19
00:01:06,068 --> 00:01:09,446
74 turndowns - only one comes through.

20
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:13,075
Alaska.

21
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:15,870
What do you mean?

22
00:01:16,036 --> 00:01:21,834
The State agreed to finance my medical
education to the tune of $125,000.

23
00:01:21,876 --> 00:01:28,757
In return, I agreed to be their
indentured slave for the next four years.

24
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:30,467
What?

25
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,846
You ever been to Alaska?

26
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:36,891
Of course. What kind of
schmuck do you think I am?

27
00:01:36,932 --> 00:01:40,227
Elaine, she's a third-year
law student at NYU...

28
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:43,063
We came out last summer.
We loved the place.

29
00:01:43,147 --> 00:01:47,693
Well, not loved, but we both agreed
it is definitely doable.

30
00:01:50,988 --> 00:01:53,449
What are you trying to say?

31
00:01:53,616 --> 00:01:56,285
Are you trying to tell me something?

32
00:01:56,368 --> 00:01:58,412
Good luck.

33
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,399
Joe! Sorry, it's been crazy.

34
00:03:08,482 --> 00:03:11,193
Great to see you again.
How was your flight?

35
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:13,696
- Not bad.
- Good. Come on in.

36
00:03:15,865 --> 00:03:17,867
I got it.

37
00:03:20,578 --> 00:03:23,622
I'll need a day or two
to get settled in at the condo.

38
00:03:23,747 --> 00:03:29,128
A phone, cable, that sort of thing,
before I check in at the hospital.

39
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:34,425
- I've got some exciting news for you, Joe.
- Joel. Really?

40
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:38,554
- Ever been to the French Riviera?
- In France?

41
00:03:38,596 --> 00:03:45,144
My lady and I were doing Europe.
We did the Rivieras - French and Italian.

42
00:03:45,227 --> 00:03:49,106
And then we jumped up to Scandinavia -
she's Danish, a model -

43
00:03:49,231 --> 00:03:52,776
before jumping down
to Zermatt in Switzerland.

44
00:03:52,902 --> 00:03:54,945
- Sounds great.
- Do you think?

45
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,282
Actually, it was incredibly disappointing.

46
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:00,784
Really? Why?

47
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:03,871
Because, Joel,
once you have experienced Alaska -

48
00:04:03,996 --> 00:04:07,541
and I am talking about the real Alaska -

49
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,377
everything else pales in comparison.

50
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:14,632
Which brings me to my big surprise.
We don't need you.

51
00:04:14,673 --> 00:04:20,638
- What are you talking about?
- You're expendable, Joel. Superfluous.

52
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:22,973
You're pulling my chain, right?

53
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,269
We overfunded and we have
more physicians than we need.

54
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:29,271
This is great news!

55
00:04:29,438 --> 00:04:32,358
What you're saying is...
you don't need me.

56
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:34,485
That's right.

57
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:40,366
- This is great news!
- So we've decided to set you up in Cicely,

58
00:04:40,407 --> 00:04:45,246
situated in an area that we Alaskans
refer to as the Alaskan Riviera.

59
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:49,458
Ideal weather, breathtaking scenery,
shopping, dining...

60
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,044
Aspen's got nothing on this place.

61
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:56,257
- Where is this Cicely?
- Bus ride from Anchorage.

62
00:04:56,423 --> 00:05:01,637
We've arranged for your lodging and
office, and the city is extremely excited.

63
00:05:01,762 --> 00:05:03,639
OK, um...

64
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:07,309
- What if I don't like it?
- You'll leave.

65
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:11,647
Let's just get this straight.
If I don't like it, I can leave?

66
00:05:11,814 --> 00:05:13,190
Absolutely.

67
00:05:18,028 --> 00:05:20,531
Well... it does look pretty.

68
00:05:20,656 --> 00:05:22,366
It's gorgeous.

69
00:07:10,182 --> 00:07:12,101
- Dr Fleischman?
- Yeah?

70
00:07:12,226 --> 00:07:14,728
Hi, I'm Ed.

71
00:07:16,981 --> 00:07:19,900
- What about rap?
- What about it?

72
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:24,780
- Well, are you into it?
- No, not particularly.

73
00:07:26,657 --> 00:07:30,160
Here we go. Richard Berry. R&B classic.

74
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:40,296
- You're a doctor, right?
- Yeah. Look, where are we?

75
00:07:40,421 --> 00:07:46,302
Not like Dr Toni Grant. She's on the radio.
Helps with your personal problems.

76
00:07:46,302 --> 00:07:50,973
"He's in sinus tach. Give me an x-ray,
stat: Cervical, spine, chest and abdomen."

77
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:53,184
"Call ortho for his leg. Call thoracic."

78
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:57,605
"Tell 'em we've got a pneumothorax,
possibly secondary to fragment."

79
00:07:57,771 --> 00:08:01,066
Just St Elsewhere. I love that show.

80
00:08:03,402 --> 00:08:07,448
I sail the ship all alone

81
00:08:07,531 --> 00:08:11,202
I never think I'll make it home

82
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:13,287
And Louie Louie

83
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:16,540
Well, me gotta go

84
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,668
- Hey, where...
- See ya!

85
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,754
Where are you goin'?

86
00:08:22,963 --> 00:08:24,548
Home.

87
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:29,637
Are you kiddin' me?
You gotta take me to Mr Minnifield!

88
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,182
You can return the tapes to me later.

89
00:08:33,224 --> 00:08:35,184
Hey! Hey!

90
00:08:37,061 --> 00:08:38,062
Oh, my God!

91
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:41,690
I smell the rose in her hair

92
00:08:41,774 --> 00:08:43,817
And Louie Louie

93
00:08:45,653 --> 00:08:47,696
We gotta go

94
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:50,533
Well, Louie Louie

95
00:08:53,244 --> 00:08:55,287
We gotta go

96
00:08:56,997 --> 00:09:00,668
Me see Jamaican moon above

97
00:09:00,835 --> 00:09:04,588
It won't be long me see me love

98
00:09:04,713 --> 00:09:08,300
Me take her in my arms and then

99
00:09:08,425 --> 00:09:12,096
I tell her I never leave again

100
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:14,223
And Louie Louie

101
00:09:15,015 --> 00:09:17,351
Well, we gotta go

102
00:09:18,936 --> 00:09:20,938
I said now Louie Louie

103
00:09:23,065 --> 00:09:25,025
Well, we gotta go

104
00:09:26,443 --> 00:09:29,280
I said we gotta go

105
00:09:30,322 --> 00:09:32,825
Well, we gotta go

106
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:43,919
Dr Fleischman!

107
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,844
Minnifield?

108
00:10:13,324 --> 00:10:15,659
What part of New York
are you from, son?

109
00:10:15,784 --> 00:10:19,622
- Flushing.
- What part's that? Bronx?

110
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,667
- Queens. You know New York?
- No, I can't say that I do.

111
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:27,963
Spent some time on the East Coast,
mostly around Washington DC.

112
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:30,299
Satellite Beach, Florida.

113
00:10:30,382 --> 00:10:34,261
I've only been to New York
one time, for a parade.

114
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:36,305
- Macy's Day?
- Ticker tape.

115
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:40,476
Goin' down Fifth Avenue
in the back of an open Caddy.

116
00:10:40,518 --> 00:10:44,146
- I was an astronaut, son.
- Really? No kidding?

117
00:10:44,188 --> 00:10:45,981
Sit.

118
00:10:47,358 --> 00:10:51,529
Wow, that's incredible.
I've never met an astronaut before.

119
00:10:51,654 --> 00:10:54,323
I watched those missions as a kid.

120
00:10:54,365 --> 00:10:57,535
- Ever go into outer space?
- Took my ride.

121
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:03,833
Joel, I wanna take this opportunity
to be the first to welcome you here.

122
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:09,129
When I heard we had a crack at a Jew
doctor from New York City, I jumped.

123
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:11,340
You boys do outstanding work.

124
00:11:11,465 --> 00:11:13,467
Thanks.

125
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:15,970
There's lots of opportunity here.

126
00:11:16,053 --> 00:11:20,850
When I first came here 20 years ago, there
was nothing but natural surroundings.

127
00:11:20,975 --> 00:11:25,187
Unseen by white man
since before time began.

128
00:11:26,522 --> 00:11:30,651
First thing I did,
I bought 15,000 acres of land.

129
00:11:30,693 --> 00:11:36,991
Second thing I did, I started
a radio station and a newspaper. Why?

130
00:11:37,157 --> 00:11:42,454
Communications. If a man's got
something to sell or something to say,

131
00:11:42,538 --> 00:11:45,207
he'd better get it out there.

132
00:11:45,249 --> 00:11:47,960
And by golly, I had it, and I still do.

133
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:52,548
We've got an outstanding little town here,
Joel, ready to step up in the worid.

134
00:11:52,631 --> 00:11:57,553
We've got natural resources,
we've got land, we've got wildlife,

135
00:11:57,595 --> 00:12:00,014
just waiting to be fondled.

136
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:02,183
And now, Joel...

137
00:12:02,224 --> 00:12:04,810
Now... we've got you.

138
00:12:08,731 --> 00:12:10,774
Come on, son.

139
00:12:12,276 --> 00:12:14,361
Let's do it.

140
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:50,773
Is this it? Is this the town?

141
00:12:54,276 --> 00:12:57,404
This is it. This is Cicely.

142
00:13:04,203 --> 00:13:07,456
She and Roslyn founded the town
97 years ago.

143
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,629
Rumour and innuendo notwithstanding,
they were just good friends.

144
00:13:13,796 --> 00:13:17,675
A hippy passing through
painted that picture.

145
00:13:17,758 --> 00:13:23,430
He was so high on weed that he forgot the
apostrophe S. I squeezed that in myself.

146
00:13:23,472 --> 00:13:27,977
- But where is the rest of the town?
- It's coming, son.

147
00:13:28,143 --> 00:13:32,648
A big Burger King,
shopping malls, 31 flavours...

148
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:36,026
It's all gonna be here. Maybe not today,

149
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:40,030
maybe not tomorrow, but it's coming.

150
00:13:40,114 --> 00:13:42,491
I can guarantee you that.

151
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:52,042
Son of a...

152
00:13:56,172 --> 00:14:00,926
I told that Ed I wanted him
to throw a new coat of paint on here.

153
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,013
This place needs more than a paint job.

154
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:09,351
Son, I had no idea this wouldn't be done
before you got here.

155
00:14:10,477 --> 00:14:14,648
Before I got here?
This is my office?!

156
00:14:14,732 --> 00:14:19,361
A few curtains, a couple of heads
on the wall, you're in business.

157
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:22,031
Come on, son. Sit down.

158
00:14:22,114 --> 00:14:25,117
Relax. Get a feel for the place.

159
00:14:25,201 --> 00:14:29,872
While I find out what the hell
that Indian's been up to.

160
00:14:41,008 --> 00:14:45,721
- Who are you?
- Marilyn. I'm here for the job.

161
00:15:02,154 --> 00:15:04,406
- Phone?
- Back there, on the wall.

162
00:15:17,294 --> 00:15:20,297
Pete Gilliam, please.

163
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:22,591
Pete? Joel Fleischman.

164
00:15:22,716 --> 00:15:25,261
I'm in Cicely.
I've taken a look around.

165
00:15:25,302 --> 00:15:30,766
I've checked out the place and thought
about it long and hard, and I want out.

166
00:15:30,808 --> 00:15:35,980
I don't have my contract. I'm on a phone
in a bar in the middle of nowhere.

167
00:15:36,063 --> 00:15:39,024
What? It says what?!

168
00:15:39,108 --> 00:15:44,071
No, no, no, listen to me.
You said if I didn't like it, I could leave.

169
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:48,450
No, I don't "don't like it".
I hate it! I demand to leave!

170
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:51,829
You're not the one who has
to spend the next four years

171
00:15:51,912 --> 00:15:57,459
in a godforsaken hole-in-the-wall pigsty
with a bunch of dirty, psychotic redne...

172
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:03,132
I am a graduate of Columbia University
School of Physicians and Surgeons.

173
00:16:03,215 --> 00:16:05,926
I did my residency at Beth Zion hospital,

174
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:09,346
one of the finest medical facilities
in New York - and the worid.

175
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:13,934
I will not spend the best years of my life
in the worst place on earth!

176
00:16:13,976 --> 00:16:15,978
Let me tell you, if you think...

177
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,336
Collect call from Joel, please.

178
00:16:42,838 --> 00:16:46,175
Hi. Honey.
Yeah, I'm here.

179
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,844
Look, um...
Yeah, it is, it's lovely.

180
00:16:48,969 --> 00:16:51,722
Do me a favour.
Run through my contract.

181
00:16:51,847 --> 00:16:56,018
Is there a stipulation as to
location of medical practice?

182
00:16:56,185 --> 00:17:00,105
Just suburban Anchorage.
Could you do that for me?

183
00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:02,816
Today. Yeah, OK.

184
00:17:02,983 --> 00:17:05,027
I miss you too, sweetheart.

185
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:08,864
The number is 907-555-7823.

186
00:17:09,031 --> 00:17:11,659
I'm gonna wait for your call, OK?

187
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,411
OK, yeah, no, me too.

188
00:17:14,453 --> 00:17:16,038
OK.

189
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,883
Women.

190
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:35,766
- My stomach's a mess. You got a seltzer?
- Seltzer?

191
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,018
Yeah, you know.

192
00:17:38,102 --> 00:17:41,647
Seltzer. It's water with bubbles.

193
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,025
Hi. Have you heard
the new Bel Biv Devoe?

194
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:46,277
What?

195
00:17:46,443 --> 00:17:49,238
I think that one's gonna go platinum.

196
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,325
Maurice asks if you've got the 16 cases
of lemon-lime for the festival.

197
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:56,620
I couldn't get lemon-lime,
so I got orange.

198
00:17:56,745 --> 00:18:00,749
- OK, that'll do.
- Do you have any aspirin back there?

199
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:05,421
I was gonna call Maurice and
tell him about the change myself.

200
00:18:05,588 --> 00:18:08,841
You were gonna call Maurice?

201
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,303
I'm thinkin' about it.

202
00:18:14,763 --> 00:18:16,932
I don't think you should do that.

203
00:18:17,057 --> 00:18:20,269
- Do what?
- Call Maurice.

204
00:18:21,437 --> 00:18:23,230
Why is that?

205
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:27,109
It'll set him off and then
he'll be blowing your brains out.

206
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:30,654
If we bury you,
it will ruin the festival for everybody.

207
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:33,657
I'll take that into consideration, Ed.

208
00:18:33,782 --> 00:18:37,328
But there is a time for everything
and in my opinion,

209
00:18:37,453 --> 00:18:41,707
it's time for me and Maurice
to settle things once and for all.

210
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:44,126
I hope you don't do that.

211
00:18:48,214 --> 00:18:50,341
Well, I'll see you later.

212
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:13,447
You been perched here for a few hours.
You must have worked up an appetite.

213
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:15,908
Oh, thanks. What do I owe you?

214
00:19:16,033 --> 00:19:18,369
It's my pleasure.

215
00:19:18,452 --> 00:19:20,621
- Joel Fleischman.
- Holling Vincoeur.

216
00:19:20,704 --> 00:19:22,957
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

217
00:19:22,998 --> 00:19:27,002
Look, um, I guess
you heard before when I was...

218
00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:34,176
Anyway, no offence intended.
I was just... I was a little...

219
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:36,679
a little upset, that's all.

220
00:19:36,762 --> 00:19:43,269
- You haven't heard from your attorney?
- No, but these are complex legal issues.

221
00:19:43,352 --> 00:19:48,190
They take quite some time to sort out.
Besides, she's got finals.

222
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,735
Well, best of luck to you.

223
00:19:51,861 --> 00:19:54,530
- Mr Vincoeur?
- Holling.

224
00:19:55,698 --> 00:19:58,576
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

225
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:00,828
Go right ahead.

226
00:20:00,995 --> 00:20:04,498
Why is Maurice gonna kill you?

227
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:07,209
Well, that's a long story.

228
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:11,172
Do you see that young lady over there?

229
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:14,758
She's quite something
to look at, isn't she?

230
00:20:14,884 --> 00:20:18,596
- She sure is.
- Miss Northwest Passage.

231
00:20:19,555 --> 00:20:22,766
Maurice brought her up here to marry her.

232
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:26,729
At that time,
Maurice and I were best of friends.

233
00:20:26,896 --> 00:20:28,856
Like most folks around here,

234
00:20:29,023 --> 00:20:32,776
he and Shelly spent a lot of time
in this establishment.

235
00:20:32,943 --> 00:20:37,239
One day Shelly appeared
at the bar without Maurice,

236
00:20:37,364 --> 00:20:40,534
said if I wanted her, she was mine.

237
00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:45,289
I did.

238
00:20:45,414 --> 00:20:50,294
Well, since then,
Maurice hasn't set foot in here.

239
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:55,549
He said if I ever tried talking to him
again, he'd blow my brains out.

240
00:20:55,591 --> 00:20:58,260
Wow.

241
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,388
And you haven't spoken since?

242
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:03,182
Not yet.

243
00:21:04,808 --> 00:21:09,730
- Can I get you something else, Joel?
- No, that's fine. Thanks a lot.

244
00:21:17,112 --> 00:21:18,989
Hello.

245
00:21:19,114 --> 00:21:21,992
- Yeah, hold on a second.
- Dr Fleischman?

246
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,119
Clem Tillman! Telephone!

247
00:21:24,286 --> 00:21:27,540
- I'm Maggie O'Connell.
- Yeah, so? Clem Tillman?

248
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:30,584
- I've been looking for you.
- What kind of name is Clem?

249
00:21:30,793 --> 00:21:34,505
- What's it short for? Clemton? Clemlock?
- I don't have a lot of time...

250
00:21:34,588 --> 00:21:38,676
Are you Clem? Keep it short
cos I'm expecting an important call.

251
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:41,679
If you'd rather spend the night here
than at my place...

252
00:21:41,762 --> 00:21:46,475
Where did you go to trade school? This
petulant-aggressive thing is a real turn-off.

253
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,311
- Look, buddy...
- I'm engaged to a real knockout.

254
00:21:49,353 --> 00:21:54,567
Do yourself a favour and
take your business someplace else.

255
00:21:56,318 --> 00:21:59,488
I am not a hooker, you jerk.

256
00:21:59,572 --> 00:22:01,615
I'm your landlord.

257
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,418
I wasn't trying to be rude.

258
00:22:12,626 --> 00:22:17,715
If you'd been direct, there wouldn't
have been any misunderstanding.

259
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,553
By the way, I appreciate
your help with the luggage!

260
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,140
- You making a fire?
- Yeah.

261
00:22:26,223 --> 00:22:29,143
Good, it is a little nippy in here.

262
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:32,021
- What do you do for heat?
- This is the heat.

263
00:22:32,062 --> 00:22:34,857
There's a wood-burning stove
in the kitchen.

264
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:38,402
- What do you do for wood?
- Chop it.

265
00:22:39,486 --> 00:22:41,071
Ah.

266
00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:50,372
You know, this place really is... charming,
in a - you know - charming sort of way.

267
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:55,252
I'm not really big on the great outdoors,

268
00:22:55,419 --> 00:22:58,756
but I can tell a person might...

269
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,176
So, what, um...

270
00:23:05,846 --> 00:23:09,767
The State pays you to rent
this place out to me, is that it?

271
00:23:09,892 --> 00:23:11,936
Maurice pays me.

272
00:23:12,102 --> 00:23:17,858
- It's an interesting profession.
- It's an investment. I fly.

273
00:23:17,942 --> 00:23:24,532
What, you're a stewardess?
I'm sorry - flight attendant. Which airline?

274
00:23:24,657 --> 00:23:28,285
- I own my own plane. I'm a pilot.
- Wow.

275
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:31,121
It's not a 747.
I run an air taxi.

276
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:38,087
- There are clean linens in the closet.
- Great.

277
00:23:38,254 --> 00:23:41,131
Look, um, does the phone work?

278
00:23:41,257 --> 00:23:45,719
It's just in case I get hungry.
I wanna order in some takeout.

279
00:23:45,845 --> 00:23:48,806
Look, again, I'm sorry about the brouhaha.

280
00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:52,726
I'm leaving tomorrow, so if
I don't get a chance to say goodbye,

281
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,604
thanks again for your hospitality.

282
00:23:55,646 --> 00:23:57,606
Goodbye.

283
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:03,445
- What about this garbage bag?
- Just put it out back.

284
00:24:07,867 --> 00:24:10,953
- It's a gigantic rat!
- That's right.

285
00:24:39,815 --> 00:24:42,651
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God...

286
00:24:42,735 --> 00:24:47,114
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God!

287
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:54,497
Oh, my God!

288
00:25:52,137 --> 00:25:55,015
Did you run all the way
into town, Dr Fleischman?

289
00:25:55,057 --> 00:25:57,643
- Uh-huh.
- That's a seven-mile run.

290
00:25:57,726 --> 00:26:00,396
- Uh-huh.
- You must be a serious runner.

291
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:03,107
Not since the seventh grade.

292
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,234
- Just the water, then?
- Yeah.

293
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,947
- No, gimme a bagel and cream cheese.
- What's a bagel?

294
00:26:10,072 --> 00:26:15,244
- I'll just take the beef jerky, OK?
- Take a spicy one. Three dollars.

295
00:26:15,286 --> 00:26:21,458
Look, I heard a rumour on the road
that the first bus out of here leaves today.

296
00:26:21,584 --> 00:26:24,587
No, I haven't heard that.
Would you like a schedule?

297
00:26:24,712 --> 00:26:25,921
Yeah.

298
00:26:43,731 --> 00:26:48,068
- What are you all doing here?
- They're waiting to see the doctor.

299
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,613
Well, um, yeah, see, look.

300
00:26:50,696 --> 00:26:53,782
I am a doctor, but I'm very sorry.

301
00:26:53,949 --> 00:26:58,496
I can't see any of you
because I'm not staying.

302
00:26:59,497 --> 00:27:02,458
See, I have a bus schedule, so...

303
00:27:03,417 --> 00:27:06,795
Although I am a doctor, I'm not really...

304
00:27:07,463 --> 00:27:09,798
I'm not the doctor.

305
00:27:10,341 --> 00:27:12,676
Yeah, so, um...

306
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:16,430
It might be improper for me
to establish any relationships

307
00:27:16,514 --> 00:27:19,350
in a situation that's...

308
00:27:20,351 --> 00:27:22,978
that's going nowhere, so, uh...

309
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:29,443
Very nice meeting all of you,
and I wish you all the best of luck.

310
00:27:32,821 --> 00:27:35,115
Suit yourselves.

311
00:27:38,661 --> 00:27:40,538
There is no job!

312
00:28:10,442 --> 00:28:13,404
One, two, three, four,

313
00:28:13,571 --> 00:28:17,700
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

314
00:28:21,453 --> 00:28:23,539
Number one?

315
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,882
OK, what's your problem?

316
00:28:33,966 --> 00:28:36,719
I'm feeling achy and I'm hot.

317
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,804
All right, for how long?

318
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:41,140
About three years.

319
00:28:46,937 --> 00:28:49,607
You do feel warm.
Let's get a temperature.

320
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:53,569
How the hell do I get that
without a thermometer?

321
00:28:56,071 --> 00:28:58,073
There is no job.

322
00:28:58,908 --> 00:29:02,495
You could have just
wheeled it in on a cart.

323
00:29:06,081 --> 00:29:09,251
Go take a seat out there for a few minutes.

324
00:29:10,294 --> 00:29:12,379
Number two!

325
00:29:25,601 --> 00:29:27,937
Hi. Wow, what's that?

326
00:29:28,103 --> 00:29:30,397
- It's a beaver.
- Really?

327
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:33,734
Yeah, I've seen these on PBS.

328
00:29:33,776 --> 00:29:35,819
- What number are you?
- Six.

329
00:29:35,945 --> 00:29:39,240
Go out and wait your turn
like everybody else.

330
00:29:39,406 --> 00:29:43,911
- I'm sorry. So what's your problem?
- I think his teeth hurt.

331
00:29:43,994 --> 00:29:47,998
- The beaver's?
- He hasn't gnawed any wood lately.

332
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:53,796
Number six, I told you. Go out and
wait your turn like everybody else.

333
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:57,466
If you can't do that, I'll ask you to leave.

334
00:30:01,303 --> 00:30:05,599
I'd like to help you with the beaver,
but I'm not a dentist.

335
00:30:05,683 --> 00:30:08,769
Couldn't you just look at him?

336
00:30:10,312 --> 00:30:12,314
All right. Lift his lip.

337
00:30:19,697 --> 00:30:21,115
Oh, my God.

338
00:30:24,368 --> 00:30:26,370
Number six?

339
00:30:29,498 --> 00:30:32,251
You're bleeding all over the floor.

340
00:30:33,335 --> 00:30:36,672
I've seen this calibre before.
Saturday night special.

341
00:30:36,714 --> 00:30:40,509
Though nowadays you see it
every day in your finer hospitals.

342
00:30:40,634 --> 00:30:47,516
It's a gun of choice of your basic pimps,
drug dealers and pre-AK-47 gangsters.

343
00:30:47,641 --> 00:30:51,020
- I'll wrap him?
- No, thank you. I can wrap him.

344
00:30:55,191 --> 00:30:57,276
So who shot you?

345
00:30:57,401 --> 00:30:59,320
My wife.

346
00:30:59,361 --> 00:31:01,572
Why?

347
00:31:01,697 --> 00:31:06,994
She said
"Loud doesn't work with me any more."

348
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:10,331
- What?
- We've been married 17 years.

349
00:31:13,209 --> 00:31:16,378
- Man, oh, man.
- Hello, Ed.

350
00:31:16,504 --> 00:31:19,507
Hi, Walter.
Hello, Dr Fleischman.

351
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:23,052
- What happened to you?
- Edna shot me.

352
00:31:23,177 --> 00:31:26,430
- Wow.
- Ed, what are you doing here?

353
00:31:27,723 --> 00:31:29,558
Maurice wants to talk to you.

354
00:31:29,725 --> 00:31:32,937
Tell him to take a number.
I have people here.

355
00:31:33,103 --> 00:31:35,272
Oh, OK. I'll wait.

356
00:31:38,317 --> 00:31:40,361
- Bye, Walter.
- See you.

357
00:31:40,402 --> 00:31:42,655
- Bye, Marilyn.
- Bye, Ed.

358
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:03,634
Sit down, son.

359
00:32:04,552 --> 00:32:09,431
- Do much hunting, Joel?
- Just on the Lower East Side.

360
00:32:09,557 --> 00:32:11,809
For bargains.

361
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:24,738
You know, Joel...

362
00:32:24,822 --> 00:32:29,118
The most important thing
in the worid to me is friendship.

363
00:32:29,285 --> 00:32:32,955
I never believed
the written word was necessary

364
00:32:32,997 --> 00:32:36,417
when a rock-steady handshake would do.

365
00:32:36,584 --> 00:32:39,295
A man's word is his honour.

366
00:32:40,296 --> 00:32:42,631
I'm talking about commitment, son.

367
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:45,009
Loyalty.

368
00:32:45,134 --> 00:32:50,806
I believe your people refer to it as the
"Ethics of the Fathers". You get my drift?

369
00:32:52,808 --> 00:32:56,437
- Well, I'm sure I will.
- You signed a contract, Joel.

370
00:32:56,604 --> 00:33:01,984
But much more important than that...
you gave your word.

371
00:33:02,026 --> 00:33:06,238
I intend to hold you to that word
within the bounds of the law.

372
00:33:06,322 --> 00:33:08,866
If necessary,
without the bounds of the law.

373
00:33:08,949 --> 00:33:13,496
- Are you threatening me?
- If you have any notions of running,

374
00:33:13,621 --> 00:33:20,336
there's the $125,000 that the good people
of Alaska put into your medical education.

375
00:33:20,503 --> 00:33:25,216
As far as I'm concerned,
Fleischman, that's my money.

376
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:31,055
Who do you think you're talking to? I am
not some putz just off the caribou farm.

377
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,390
I'm from New York City.

378
00:33:33,516 --> 00:33:37,895
I've walked 42nd Street at midnight and
taken the Lexington Avenue line at 2am.

379
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,022
I have stiffed cabbies.

380
00:33:40,189 --> 00:33:45,110
So don't try this strong-armed cowboy
crap on me, cos it won't do squat!

381
00:33:45,194 --> 00:33:47,238
Nooo!

382
00:33:56,622 --> 00:33:59,416
So, anyway, after med school,

383
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,420
Elaine and I moved into her place
so I could finish my residency.

384
00:34:03,546 --> 00:34:06,715
Elaine is from Brooklyn, Canarsie.
You're from...

385
00:34:06,841 --> 00:34:09,385
- Grosse Pointe.
- Michigan, right.

386
00:34:09,426 --> 00:34:14,181
Grosse Pointe. Isn't that
an ugly name for a rich city?

387
00:34:14,265 --> 00:34:17,852
So you left college and came here
with the mountain climber...

388
00:34:17,893 --> 00:34:21,063
He was a graduate student,
writing a book on climbing.

389
00:34:21,105 --> 00:34:23,732
The book, right. Mountain of something...

390
00:34:23,774 --> 00:34:26,277
Mountain of my Misgiving.

391
00:34:26,402 --> 00:34:29,864
Something funny about that?

392
00:34:31,448 --> 00:34:34,285
So what happened to him,
up there on the mountain?

393
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:38,289
He never actually climbed it. He left.

394
00:34:38,455 --> 00:34:40,291
He dumped you?

395
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:44,461
No, he didn't dump me,
not that it's any of your business.

396
00:34:44,587 --> 00:34:47,256
He happened to be wildly in love with me.

397
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:51,594
- You got cold feet, huh?
- No, I didn't get cold feet.

398
00:34:51,677 --> 00:34:55,431
I liked him OK, I just didn't... love him.

399
00:34:55,472 --> 00:34:57,391
OK?

400
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:00,644
Besides...

401
00:35:02,021 --> 00:35:04,565
- He's dead.
- Dead?

402
00:35:06,442 --> 00:35:09,445
Dead, as in deceased?

403
00:35:09,528 --> 00:35:12,072
- Ooh.
- What do you mean, "ooh"?

404
00:35:12,114 --> 00:35:14,533
I didn't kill him.

405
00:35:14,658 --> 00:35:17,620
We were on a glacier.
I take a hike.

406
00:35:17,786 --> 00:35:21,248
He decides to take a nap... and froze.

407
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:27,463
- What?
- You have the reddest lips I've ever seen.

408
00:35:27,588 --> 00:35:33,677
I mean, Elaine has red lips, but
I don't think I've ever seen lips that red,

409
00:35:33,844 --> 00:35:37,348
except maybe on a birthday balloon.

410
00:35:39,975 --> 00:35:41,519
You're drunk.

411
00:35:41,602 --> 00:35:44,813
Not only that, but
do you realise you're pretty?

412
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:52,029
Not great-looking, but you are
definitely pretty, in a clean sort of way.

413
00:35:52,112 --> 00:35:55,699
- I'll get the check.
- Not only that...

414
00:36:34,155 --> 00:36:36,031
Morning.

415
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,702
Where am I?

416
00:36:39,827 --> 00:36:43,455
Maggie's.
She had a mail run this morning.

417
00:36:54,133 --> 00:36:57,636
- Do you mind if I...?
- No, help yourself.

418
00:37:03,893 --> 00:37:06,437
Who are you?

419
00:37:06,604 --> 00:37:08,439
Rick.

420
00:37:09,773 --> 00:37:12,026
She left the keys to her truck.

421
00:37:13,777 --> 00:37:17,364
She didn't think you'd feel like
jogging into town today.

422
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:24,580
The bed I slept in last night is
the same bed Maggie slept in?

423
00:37:24,747 --> 00:37:27,541
No. We sleep in the other room.

424
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:29,460
Oh.

425
00:37:30,878 --> 00:37:32,546
Oh.

426
00:37:39,803 --> 00:37:41,555
Hey, Marilyn.

427
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:46,101
This is the last time I'm gonna
have to tell you this. There is no job.

428
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:50,940
Would you please stop smiling at me?
You're constantly smiling at me.

429
00:37:51,065 --> 00:37:54,568
- What is he doing here?
- She did it again.

430
00:38:00,366 --> 00:38:03,619
For God's sakes!
What did she use on you, a steak knife?

431
00:38:03,744 --> 00:38:08,833
Swiss army. She snuck up behind me.
If I didn't bury the gun I'd be dead by now.

432
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:12,127
- Give me the keys, Walter. It's my truck.
- Who are you?

433
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:15,130
- Over my dead body.
- Six's wife.

434
00:38:15,214 --> 00:38:18,425
- If that's the way you want it, Walter...
- Hey, hey!

435
00:38:18,467 --> 00:38:23,055
- What's the problem here?
- Him. He's the problem.

436
00:38:23,097 --> 00:38:27,601
You've gnawed through my nerves
like a rat through plaster, and I've had it.

437
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:30,104
- Lay it off on me!
- I'm gonna finish you!

438
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:35,651
- Come on, you wanna do it? Let's do it!
- Quiet! This is my office!

439
00:38:35,651 --> 00:38:40,823
People get sick, people get shot, people
get hurt, I don't have a problem with that.

440
00:38:40,906 --> 00:38:43,868
Believe me,
I wouldn't have it any other way.

441
00:38:43,993 --> 00:38:46,704
You know how close you came
to killing this man?

442
00:38:46,787 --> 00:38:49,373
If you hadn't hit his scapula
or bounced off a rib,

443
00:38:49,456 --> 00:38:51,917
you might have
punctured his aorta or a lung.

444
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:55,921
With really bad luck, you might have
hit the muscle, strangling his heart.

445
00:38:56,046 --> 00:39:00,634
If that didn't finish him off,
you might have severed his spinal cord,

446
00:39:00,718 --> 00:39:04,471
leaving him belly-up
like a bug on its back.

447
00:39:04,555 --> 00:39:08,767
I had no idea it was this complicated.

448
00:39:08,851 --> 00:39:11,353
Well, it is.

449
00:39:11,478 --> 00:39:16,400
So I ask you again: What has this man
done to deserve a cardiac tamponade?

450
00:39:19,069 --> 00:39:22,239
- I'm invisible...
- I told you...

451
00:39:22,364 --> 00:39:27,411
I've tried kindness, I've tried crying,

452
00:39:27,536 --> 00:39:30,873
I've tried... laughter.

453
00:39:35,503 --> 00:39:38,088
I'm at the end of my rope, Walter.

454
00:39:38,255 --> 00:39:42,218
If I don't kill you,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

455
00:39:44,261 --> 00:39:47,181
- Number nine?
- Number six.

456
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:52,728
I don't listen to her because
no matter what I do, it's wrong.

457
00:39:52,811 --> 00:39:57,775
She doesn't want me to drink in bed,
I don't drink in bed.

458
00:39:57,858 --> 00:40:00,236
She doesn't like me with the guys,

459
00:40:00,361 --> 00:40:04,406
and then she complains
I'm home too much.

460
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:09,119
So I've tuned her out.

461
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:16,544
Well, what are we gonna do now?

462
00:40:17,586 --> 00:40:20,130
As far as I can tell,
we have three ways to go.

463
00:40:20,214 --> 00:40:25,261
Divorce, separation, or you can
start talking to one another.

464
00:40:25,386 --> 00:40:28,138
How many hands do I see for divorce?

465
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:33,310
Separation?

466
00:40:34,937 --> 00:40:36,939
Well, then...

467
00:40:37,064 --> 00:40:40,276
Is that a phone?

468
00:40:41,777 --> 00:40:45,489
That is definitely a telephone.

469
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:49,076
Well, start talking.

470
00:41:02,047 --> 00:41:03,549
What?

471
00:41:03,632 --> 00:41:08,137
Elaine! No, I know I'm not in Anchorage.

472
00:41:08,179 --> 00:41:13,517
Why am I in Cicely, Alaska? Long story.
I promise I'll explain when I get back.

473
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:16,604
The most important thing
is what my contract says.

474
00:41:16,645 --> 00:41:18,939
Uh-huh?

475
00:41:21,066 --> 00:41:22,776
Huh.

476
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,404
And if I leave?

477
00:41:25,529 --> 00:41:28,324
$10,000 or 18 years in jail.

478
00:41:28,491 --> 00:41:30,659
And 18 years in jail?!

479
00:42:27,049 --> 00:42:29,552
They're still talking.

480
00:42:31,554 --> 00:42:33,973
I'll stitch him up.

481
00:42:34,056 --> 00:42:36,225
No.

482
00:42:36,433 --> 00:42:38,394
It's OK, I'll do it.

483
00:42:59,415 --> 00:43:01,417
Good golly, Miss Molly

484
00:43:02,459 --> 00:43:05,129
Sure likes a ball

485
00:43:05,254 --> 00:43:08,174
When you're rockin' and a-rollin'

486
00:43:08,215 --> 00:43:10,759
Did you hear your momma call?

487
00:43:23,731 --> 00:43:25,691
All right!

488
00:43:25,816 --> 00:43:28,903
The town of Cicely wants
to welcome all of you

489
00:43:29,028 --> 00:43:35,409
to the ninth annual Arrowhead County
Summer Wonderland Festival.

490
00:43:37,786 --> 00:43:42,958
We'd especially like to welcome
our friends from Middlechurch,

491
00:43:43,042 --> 00:43:48,797
who came here to celebrate with us -
that's 300 miles away as the crow flies.

492
00:43:51,967 --> 00:43:54,678
Hello, Dr Fleischman.

493
00:43:54,845 --> 00:43:58,098
Mooseburger or caribou dog?

494
00:43:58,182 --> 00:44:00,017
Mooseburger.

495
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:04,480
And I'm proud to be here
to celebrate that fact!

496
00:44:04,605 --> 00:44:10,611
You all have a really good time. Sit back,
enjoy the food, drink and fellowship,

497
00:44:10,736 --> 00:44:14,406
and have a hell of a good time!

498
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:17,159
North to the future!

499
00:44:28,379 --> 00:44:31,423
What time is it in New York City now?

500
00:44:32,883 --> 00:44:34,927
It's around midnight.

501
00:44:36,178 --> 00:44:41,517
So I guess maybe you and your fiancée'd
be coming back from a movie about now.

502
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:46,021
Maybe stop by a little café
for a cup of espresso,

503
00:44:46,188 --> 00:44:49,275
pick up the Sunday edition
of the New York Times,

504
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:53,863
and some fresh, hot bagels
for breakfast tomorrow.

505
00:44:54,029 --> 00:44:56,031
Sounds about right.

506
00:44:57,032 --> 00:44:59,368
How do you know about bagels?

507
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:03,414
Oh, I saw Manhattan.
I think Woody's a genius.

508
00:45:11,255 --> 00:45:13,340
Maurice?

509
00:45:27,354 --> 00:45:30,566
I got nothin' to say to you, Maurice.

510
00:45:31,484 --> 00:45:34,528
But I'm sayin' it anyway.

511
00:45:38,532 --> 00:45:40,534
How's she doin'?

512
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:44,413
She's fine.

513
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:51,587
I miss you, Maurice.
I miss you bein' around.

514
00:45:53,422 --> 00:45:56,717
Things kinda got turned upside-down.

515
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,304
Gravity.

516
00:46:02,306 --> 00:46:05,434
It keeps you rooted to the ground.

517
00:46:07,311 --> 00:46:10,606
In space, there's not any gravity.

518
00:46:10,648 --> 00:46:15,611
You just kind of leave your feet
and go floatin' around.

519
00:46:18,656 --> 00:46:21,492
Is that what it's like, Holling?

520
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,870
What?

521
00:46:24,995 --> 00:46:26,997
Bein' in love.

522
00:46:44,598 --> 00:46:47,309
How do you like the mooseburger?

523
00:46:47,434 --> 00:46:51,313
- Little gamy.
- Well, you'll get used to it.

524
00:46:52,273 --> 00:46:55,776
The dream is gone I thought was mine

525
00:46:55,943 --> 00:46:59,363
There's nothing left for me to do

526
00:46:59,488 --> 00:47:05,619
But cry over you

527
00:47:05,703 --> 00:47:09,957
Well, I never felt
more like singin' the blues

528
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,294
Cos I never thought that I'd ever lose

529
00:47:13,419 --> 00:47:15,754
Your love, dear

530
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:21,177
You got me singin' the blues
